## Training Instructions
### Setup
* Apps are located in the *_train_apps* folder
* If prompted to select a 'kernel', select *py_geo_env*

### Navigation
##### General tips
* Be patient! Things may render slowly. Wait for the app to catch-up before clicking a lot or trying to zoom/move the imagery too much.
* To speed things up, avoid using the VPN or work in the office. Also avoid screensharing (e.g., on Teams) while navigating in the app.

##### Drawing
* Select the *draw-polygon* icon (just above the *save* icon on the left of the image).
* To draw a polygon:
    * double-click on the image where you want to start
    * single-click to add vertices
    * double-click again to finish the polygon (it will automatically draw the last line to the start vertex)
* To move/delete a polygon:
    * single-click on a polygon that has already been drawn and completed
    * the polygon should become highlighted and other polygons should become muted
    * click and drag to move the polygon
    * hit the *backspace* key to delete the polygon
* To edit a polygon's vertices:
    * *NOTE: it may be easier to just delete the polygon and draw a new one*
    * click the *edit polygon* icon on the left the image, just above the *draw polygon* icon
    * single-click a polygon to select it
    * single-click on a vertex to select it
    * drag the vertex and then single-click again to place it
    * hit *backspace* key to delete a vertex
